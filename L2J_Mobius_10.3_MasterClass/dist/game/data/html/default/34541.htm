Welcome! My name is Karinia. I help heroes access instance zones. Kastia's Labyrinth is open for any hero who has reached Lv. 100. There is one condition, though. If you have defeated the final boss on any of the five difficulty levels, you can't enter Kastia's Labyrinth again until the next day. Keep that in mind.<br><br>
